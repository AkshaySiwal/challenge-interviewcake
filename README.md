This is my take on interview cake's questions.

Most of this has been done in Python 2.

About 1/2 the way in, and I like cake's questions, and the format. They are good review material in most cases, and in other cases, showing me things that I missed  during my CS degree.

As usual with interview questions there are inevitably the questions where you either see the solution (or have seen the solution before) or will just never get what the interviewer is asking for.

And often too, with these, I am indeed amazed at the notion that many of these can be answered

+ on a whiteboard
+ in 20 minutes or less
+ by people with no basic whiteboarding, on the fly, coding experience

If I can do a couple of these in a day, by myself, I'm pretty good with that.

So here are some code snippets to look at, play with, evaluate.

Most of the files here can be run by typing:

    python filename

at which point unit tests will kick in, and sort of verify they work. For details though, after

    python filename

you should type

    more|vi|emacs filename

to see the details
